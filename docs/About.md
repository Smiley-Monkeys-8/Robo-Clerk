## Why

Karen works at JB. She helps people join the financial market. To do that, she must read. A lot.

She gets stacks of documents. They come in all shapes and sizes. Some are clear. Others are not. Her job is to read them all and decide.

Does this person qualify? Are the documents right? Is something missing? She must know. If she’s wrong, it’s a problem.

The work is slow. The pressure is high. Each decision matters. Every mistake has a cost.

## How

We build something to help her.

## What We Are Doing

### The Problem

This is a sorting task. A decision machine.

- **Input**: Documents about a person. Many formats. Many pages.
- **Output**: Two boxes. _Accept_ or _Reject_.

### Extra Detail

When we say **Reject**, we must explain why. Not all rejections are equal. The reason shapes what comes next.

- Risk
- Missing papers
- A bad typo
- Something that doesn’t add up

Karen needs to know. The client deserves to know.

### The Rules

- **Accept**: All is clear. All checks out.
- **Reject**: Something is missing. Or something doesn’t match.

## Boundaries

We keep the data safe. It stays with us. No third parties. Unless it’s made anonymous.
